# openheard MCP server

Run your feedback board by talking to an agent. The MCP server gives Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop or any [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client everything an admin does in the dashboard: triage posts, merge duplicates, set statuses and reply, set up boards and statuses, brand the board from a website, configure and install the widget, write the help center, ship changelog entries, connect Slack or Discord, and invite the team. Every write runs the same code as the dashboard, emails and alerts included.

**Endpoint:** `https://openheard.com/api/mcp` (self-hosted: `https://your-domain/api/mcp`)
**Transport:** Streamable HTTP (stateless)
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, a key from **Settings > API keys**

## Keys

One key reaches all your workspaces. It acts as you in every workspace you administer, and can create new ones. Tools take an optional `workspace` argument (the slug); without it they act on the key's home workspace, the one it was made in. Every result names the workspace it acted on. Only admins can make keys, and a key stops reaching a workspace the moment you stop being an admin there.

Turn on **Limit to this workspace** when you make a key to share it with a teammate or a script. That key acts as an admin of its workspace only, and keeps working at that workspace's own address (`https://acme.openheard.com/api/mcp`) as well as the root one.

A limited key that names another workspace is refused, as is any key naming a workspace you do not administer.

## Install

Make a key first: **Settings > API keys**, name it, copy it (it is shown once). Leave **Limit to this workspace** off so one key reaches all your workspaces.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http openheard https://openheard.com/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer oh_your_key_here"
```

Add `--scope user` to have it in every project, or `--scope project` to share it through `.mcp.json` (keep the key out of git: use `"Authorization": "Bearer ${OPENHEARD_KEY}"` there). Check with `claude mcp list`.

Install the skill as well, so the agent knows the workflows:

```bash
cp -r skills/openheard ~/.claude/skills/openheard
```

### Cursor

**Settings > MCP > Add new MCP server**, or `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openheard": {
      "url": "https://openheard.com/api/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer oh_your_key_here" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop talks to local servers, so bridge with `mcp-remote` in `claude_desktop_config.json` (**Settings > Developer > Edit config**):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openheard": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://openheard.com/api/mcp", "--header", "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"],
      "env": { "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer oh_your_key_here" }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

### Local dev

```bash
# --account <email>: a key for all that person's workspaces. Without it the key is limited to --workspace <slug> (default "default")
OPENHEARD_LOCAL=1 bun run apps/web/src/scripts/make-api-key.ts --account you@example.com

claude mcp add --transport http openheard-local http://localhost:3003/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer oh_your_key_here"
```

## How the tools behave

- **Names or ids.** Boards, statuses and tags accept their name or id; statuses also their label (`"In progress"`).
- **Helpful errors.** A miss says what exists: `Board 'bugs' not found; boards are: 'acme-features (Feature requests)'`.
- **Compact output.** Lists return ids, titles, counts and URLs; long bodies are cut to an excerpt unless you pass `include_body: true`.
- **Idempotent where it can be.** Setting the current status, voting twice, creating a board or tag that exists, publishing a published entry: all return the current state and change nothing.
- **Destructive tools need `confirm: true`.** `delete_*`, `merge_posts` and `disconnect` refuse without it. Agents are told to ask you first.
- **Annotations.** Every tool carries MCP `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint`, so clients can auto-approve reads and ask before deletes.

## Prompts

Clients that show MCP prompts (Claude Code lists them as `/mcp__openheard__<name>`) get four ready-made workflows:

| Prompt | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `weekly-triage` | Summarize the week, find duplicates, propose statuses and replies, then apply what you approve |
| `setup-openheard` | Create or brand a workspace from a website, add boards and statuses, configure the widget and insert the snippet into this codebase |
| `ship-and-announce` | Find the posts a release ships, draft the changelog, publish it (voters and subscribers are emailed) and reply on each post |
| `reply-to-feedback` | Read a post and its thread, check duplicates and help articles, draft a reply and a status change |

## Tools

Every workspace tool also takes `workspace`. Without it a tool acts on the key's home workspace; keys limited to one workspace cannot name another.

## Rate limits

60 requests per minute per key (per IP without a key). Over the limit the server answers `429` with `Retry-After`. Website matching (`match_website`, `apply_branding`, `create_workspace` with a website) has its own limit of 5 a minute and 30 an hour per person.

## Example

> **You:** Triage this week's feedback.
>
> **Claude:** *(summarize_feedback, then find_duplicates on the new posts)* 14 new posts. "CSV export times out" looks like a duplicate of #71 "Export to CSV fails on large boards" (9 votes). Merge it? I would also move #64 and #70 to planned and reply to the three unanswered posts; drafts below.
>
> **You:** Yes to all.
>
> **Claude:** *(merge_posts with confirm: true, bulk_set_status, add_comment x3)* Done. Links: ...

## Runtime

The server uses the Web Standards Streamable HTTP transport (`WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`), stateless, one server per request. It runs on Cloudflare Workers in production and on Bun or Node locally.
