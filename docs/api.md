# openheard API v1

All endpoints live under `/api/v1/` and require a Bearer token.

## Authentication

Create an API key in **Dashboard → Settings → API keys** (or use the script below for local dev).

```
Authorization: Bearer oh_<your-key>
```

Call the API at `https://openheard.com/api/v1/` (self-hosted: your own domain). One key reaches all your workspaces: it acts as the admin who made it, in every workspace they administer. Add `?workspace=<slug>` to any endpoint to pick one; without it the key's home workspace (the one it was made in) is used. Every response names the workspace it acted on, in a `workspace` field and the `openheard-workspace` header.

A key made with **Limit to this workspace** on reaches only its own workspace, at the root address or the workspace's own (`https://acme.openheard.com/api/v1/`). A workspace the owner does not administer returns `403`, and so does a limited key naming any other workspace.

Revoked keys return `401`.

### Local dev: generate a key

```bash
OPENHEARD_LOCAL=1 bun run apps/web/src/scripts/make-api-key.ts                      # limited to "default"
OPENHEARD_LOCAL=1 bun run apps/web/src/scripts/make-api-key.ts --workspace acme       # limited to "acme"
OPENHEARD_LOCAL=1 bun run apps/web/src/scripts/make-api-key.ts --account you@example.com  # all of that person's workspaces
```

## Rate limits

All API endpoints are rate-limited to **60 requests per minute** per API key (or per IP if no key is provided).

When you exceed the limit the server returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a JSON body and a `Retry-After` header (seconds until the window resets):

```json
{ "error": "Too many requests" }
```

Back off for the number of seconds in `Retry-After` before retrying.

## Error shape

Every error returns JSON:

```json
{ "error": "Human-readable message" }
```

Status codes: `401` (bad/missing key), `403` (workspace out of reach), `404` (not found), `422` (validation), `405` (wrong method), `500` (server).

## Endpoints

### GET /api/v1/posts

List posts. Returns `{ posts, total, limit, offset }`.

| Param    | Type   | Default   | Description                            |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| board    | string | —         | Filter by board ID                     |
| status   | string | —         | Filter by status key                   |
| q        | string | —         | Search title and body                  |
| sort     | string | trending  | `top`, `new`, or `trending`            |
| limit    | number | 30        | 1–100                                  |
| offset   | number | 0         | Pagination offset                      |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  "http://localhost:3003/api/v1/posts?sort=top&limit=5"
```

### GET /api/v1/posts/:id

Single post with comments and activity timeline.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  http://localhost:3003/api/v1/posts/1
```

The post and each comment carry `attachments`, the images attached to them,
oldest first:

```json
"attachments": [
  { "id": "k3Vx9…", "url": "https://acme.openheard.com/uploads/k3Vx9…", "contentType": "image/png", "width": 1280, "height": 720 }
]
```

`width` and `height` are `null` when the image header could not be read. The
`url` needs no key: images are served to anyone who has the link. The MCP
`get_post` tool returns the same shape.

### POST /api/v1/posts

Create a post. Returns `{ id }` with status `201`.

```json
{
  "title": "Add dark mode",
  "body": "Optional longer description",
  "board": "features",
  "author_email": "user@example.com"
}
```

- `title` (required, 4–140 chars)
- `board` (required, must be a valid board ID)
- `body` (optional, max 5000 chars)
- `author_email` (optional, links to existing user)

### POST /api/v1/posts/:id/status

Change a post's status.

```json
{ "status": "planned", "note": "Optional note for followers" }
```

Accepts a status key (`open`, `review`, `planned`, `progress`, `done`, `closed`) or the workspace's custom label. It runs the same code as the dashboard: the change lands in the timeline, and voters, commenters and the author are emailed when status emails are on. Setting the current status again changes nothing.

### POST /api/v1/posts/:id/comments

Add a comment. Returns `{ id }` with status `201`.

```json
{ "body": "Thanks for the feedback!" }
```

### GET /api/v1/statuses

List workspace statuses. Returns `{ statuses: [{ key, label, color, kind, onRoadmap }] }`.

### GET /api/v1/boards

List workspace boards. Returns `{ boards: [{ id, name, description }] }`.

### GET /api/v1/changelog

List published changelog entries. Returns `{ entries: [{ id, title, body, version, publishedAt, posts }] }`.

### POST /api/v1/changelog

Create a draft changelog entry. Returns `{ id }` with status `201`.

```json
{
  "title": "v1.2 – Dark mode",
  "body": "Markdown body here",
  "version": "v1.2.0",
  "post_ids": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

### POST /api/v1/changelog/:id/publish

Publish a draft entry. Linked posts move to the "done" status, and the first publish emails changelog subscribers and the linked posts' followers, as in the dashboard. Publishing an entry that is already out returns `{ ok: true, alreadyPublished: true }` and changes nothing.

### GET /api/v1/help/collections

The published help center, grouped. Returns `{ collections: [{ id, slug, title, description, articles: [{ id, slug, title, excerpt }] }], uncategorised: [...] }`. Collections with nothing published are left out.

### GET /api/v1/help/articles?q=

Search published help articles. Title matches rank above excerpt matches, which rank above body matches.

| Param   | Type   | Description                      |
|---------|--------|----------------------------------|
| `q`     | string | Search words (required)          |
| `limit` | number | 1 to 25, default 8               |

Returns `{ articles: [{ id, slug, title, excerpt, collection: { slug, title } | null }] }`.

### GET /api/v1/help/articles/:slug

One published article with its markdown `body`, `collection`, `related` articles from the same collection, and `helpfulCount` / `unhelpfulCount`. Drafts return `404`.
